# Kivy-FeelGood-App
A mobile app that gives you a quote depending on how you're feeling.

I Followed along making this app from a python course on Udemy. Although it is not my original idea, it helped me to understand how to organize a project, the use of classes,
and learning to read documentation when using a new library. The only thing that i added on my own was a forget password functionality.
